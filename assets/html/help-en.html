<h1>How to use Ice Hockey Scoresheet</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
    The <b>game</b> is recorded as a series of <b>events</b>. There are several types of event&hellip;
</p>
<p>
    * <b>Goal</b> scored (home or away)<br/>
    * <b>Penalty</b> (home or away)<br/>
    * <b>End of period</b>
</p>
<p>
    Every event includes the time that it happens; this can be either the <b>clock time</b> within a period
    (which counts down within the period) or the <b>game time</b>, which counts up from the start of the first period.
    You record new events using the period and clock time, and they are automatically converted into game time for you.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have recorded the events for the game, the <b>Game Report</b> will display
    all the details in the format required by the EIHA official score sheet.
</p>
<p style="color:red">
    <b><i>Important</i></b> - make sure you write down the game events on a piece of paper as well as recording them in
    the scoresheet app. If the app crashes and loses the entire game record you may need to fill in the official
    scoresheet manually.
</p>
<h2>User Interface Layout</h2>
<p>
    The <b>scoreboard</b> is shown at the top of the screen, with the home and away goal totals, and the current period.
    Above the scoreboard is the title bar, which includes the <b>options menu</b>. The options menu lets you start a new game,
    save or load games, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Below the scoreboard you will normally see the <b>Game History</b>, a list of all the events recorded so far for the
    game. Between the scoreboard and the events list are a set of buttons for recording new events. Below the events
    list is the <b>Game Report</b> button which is used to access the game report, with all the information needed to
    fill in the official scoresheet.
</p>
<h3>Adding Events</h3>
<p>
    Events are added to the game using the five new event buttons.
</p>
<p>
    * HOME GOAL<br/>
    * HOME PENALTY<br/>
    * NEXT (period)<br/>
    * AWAY GOAL<br/>
    * AWAY PENALTY
</p>
<p>
    When adding goal or penalty events you will be prompted to enter additional information.
</p>
<p>
    The correct period <i>should</i> have been identified, but you can change it if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    The game clock time should be entered as it appears on the rink's scoreboard, as a four digit number with <i>no
    punctuation</i>. For example, if the clock shows 15 minutes 27 seconds left in the period, you should enter
        &quot;1527&quot;.
    If the clock shows 9:32 remaining, enter &quot;0932&quot; and if there are only 23 seconds left in the period
        then enter &quot;0023&quot;.
</p>
<p>
    The clock time will be <i>automatically</i> converted to game time (since the start of period 1) when the event is
    added to the game history.
</p>
<h3>Adding Goals</h3>
<p>
    The default goal type is &quot;E&quot; (the code for &quot;Even handed&quot;) but you can change this. As you start
    to type, valid options (E, SH, PP, DP, PS, PG, ENG) will be presented for you to select.
</p>
<p>
    You <i>must</i> enter the player number for the goal scorer. You can also add player numbers for either one or
    two assists.
</p>
<h3>Adding Penalties</h3>
<p>
    The default for penalty minutes is 2, but this can be changed as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    Penalty codes can be entered, and as with goal type valid codes are shown as you type. You can generally just type
    the first letter or two of the penalty code and then select the correct value from the list. See the end of this
    help text for a list of valid penalty codes.
</p>
<p>
    You <i>must</i> enter the number of the player receiving the penalty.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the time recorded for the penalty will be used for both the awarded time and the start time; delayed
    penalties are not currently supported. The end time is calculated automatically.
</p>
<h3>Deleting or changing events</h3>
<p>
    You can <b>delete</b> events by holding down on them for a second or two in the game history, and then selecting
    &quot;Yes&quot; at the prompt.
</p>
<p>
    You cannot currently edit and existing event. If you get an event wrong, just delete it and create it again. This
    works even if the event is not in the current period, as long as you specify the change the period for the event
    when (re)creating it.
</p>
<h2>Game Report</h2>
<p>
    The <b>Game Report</b> shows all the information for the game in the format required by the EIHA score sheet...
</p>
<p>
    * Home player stats (goals/assists/penalty minutes)<br/>
    * Home scoring<br/>
    * Home penalties<br/>
    * Away player stats<br/>
    * Away scoring<br/>
    * Away penalties<br/>
    * Period scores<br/>
    * Period penalty minutes
</p>
<p>
    You can simply copy the information from the game report screen into the written score sheet.
</p>
<p>
    All clock conversions and calculations are performed automatically from the game events.
</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
    To close this help screen, just use the Android <b>back</b> button.
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget to <b>save</b> regularly using the options menu in case the app crashes.
    If it does, launch it again and then select <b>Load Game</b> from the options menu.
</p>
<p>
    Loading and saving do not currently require a file name. A history of all previous saves is kept and <i>can</i> be
    retrieved, though there is no mechanism in the app itself to retrieve old saves.
</p>
<p>
    If the app gets "confused" and doesn't appear to display correctly, try the <b>"Refresh!"</b> option from the options menu.
</p>
<p>
    Don't use the <b>TestData!</b> option. It just adds a set of standard events to the game to help with testing.
